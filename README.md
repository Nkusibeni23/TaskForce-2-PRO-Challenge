# TaskForce 2 PRO Challenge

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It leverages modern tools and frameworks to deliver a high-performance, scalable, and visually appealing web application.

## Overview

TaskForce 2 PRO Challenge is built with a focus on **server-side rendering (SSR)** for improved performance and SEO. The app utilizes **shadcn/ui** for reusable components and styling, **Tailwind CSS** for rapid UI development, and **TypeScript** for type safety. Additionally, **Clerk** is used for user authentication and management.

### Live Demo

The app is deployed on Netlify: [TaskForce 2 PRO](https://task-force-pro.netlify.app/)  
(Note: Currently facing an internal server error 500. We are actively working on resolving the issue.)
